                <p>
                    I host my website with github pages right now. 
                </p>
                <p>
                    I chose to edit this website via github codespaces. I already have another git account setup on my machine, so this is easier for now.
                </p>
                <p>
                    The design of this current iteration of the website is inspired by https://lukesmith.xyz/.
                </p>
                <p>     
                    My next goal is to follow his guide on becoming an internet landlord: https://landchad.net/
                </p>
                <p>
                    I already tried to self host on my esp32, but that requires buying an SD card, so I will try following his tutorials next. It also looks very well thought out.
                </p>
                <p>
                    For my domain, I bought rabbimelon.com from google domains. google domains was a good platform.
                    The migration to sqaurespace was disappointing, so I was looking into alternatives. I found godaddy had a good offer on gayrabbi.com so I use godaddy. It sucks a lot.

                <ol>
                    <li>
                        Trying out new things.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        The internet has become centralized. 
                    </li>
                </ol>

                    1. This website, and the psuedo-anonymity in general, gives me an oppurtinity to try things while recieving real feedback from real humans.
                    The real world doesn't allow much room for creativity and making mistakes. Maybe it does, but i'm just too anxious.
                    A platform like this lets me express myself creativly without judgement, and I get to try new technologies by having a website, read my future plans and vision to understand.
                </p>

                <p>
                    2. There is so much information out there yet search engines have been exploited by SEO specialists, government censorship, and Apple (the devil).
                    Although everything is out there, finding stuff is hard. If you want proof, bake pitas from a recipe from google, perplexity or chatgpt. Then make pitas from my recipe.
                    Was it more pleasent to find the recipe on my website or on the alternatives? What was the cheapest way to find those recipes? Most importantly, which pita is better?

                <details class="detail-item vision">
                    <summary>Vision</summary>

                    <p>
                        First and foremost i'd like to leverage this websites existance to learn some new technologies. Ideas:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Become an internet landlord - https://landchad.net/
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Track user data (in a fun way)- I'm thinking of one of those old style website visitor count by country.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Forum/comments/log in system - Would be cool if you guys can leave comments, maybe let me know about a spelling mistake, or some thing to research.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Web graphics - this is fun, and is a good way to get payed if I get good at it.
                        </li>
                    <p>
                        The second component on my vision related to the content. I will do two main things:
                    </p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Curate links and information I find useful.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Write about stuff I find interesting - eventually i'd like to go heavy on kabbalah and jungian psychology on here.
                        </li>
                    </ul>
                    </ul>
                </details>
            </li>



                <li>
                    <details class="detail-item status">
                        <summary>Status</summary>
                        <p>
                            Everything right now is very rough work. My to do list:
                        </p>
                        <ol>
                            <li>
                                Update garden.html about my tabacco plant.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Add a webpage about my X pfp's over time.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Update and polish up my list of links.
                            </li>
                            <li>
                                Migrate to a new server - A lot of the technical stuff I want to do may require running code on the server. Github Pages only serves static webpages. Once I figure this out I'll plan out how to do everything else.
                            </li>
                        </ol>
        
                    </details>
                </li>
          

    </ul>
