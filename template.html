                    <summary>August 14th - Writing</summary>
                    <p>Over the past few years I've lost the ability to engage deeply with my ideas. The only solution to this problem is to write. I would like to eventually write my thoughts on topics such as theology, politics, philosophy, and such. Why? I guess it's tremendously satisfying to be able to verbalize feelings, and the topics listed are those which come up often and are accompanied by emotional baggage.</p>
                    <p>What to write about is a difficult question. I have many ideas, but as stated, I struggle to verbalize them. However, the solution right now is simple. I tweet a lot. So let's look at my tweets and expand on them.</p>
